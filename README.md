# Duck Radio

![](screenshot.png)

Duck Radio let's you listen to a radio stream and "duck" out news broadcasts that occur at specific times each hour for a specific
number of minutes. During that ducking time, you can listen to an
alternative radio stream that doesn't have news playing.

How to use Duck Radio:

1. Enter your main radio stream URL
2. Enter an alternative radio stream URL
3. Specify the times and duration there's news on air
4. Click `Play` start your radio experience without news

Your settings will be stored on your device, so you don't need to fiddle around every time you reload the site.
